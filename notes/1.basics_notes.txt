k = "8" -- string

k= int(k)


python statements:

instuctions to python interpreter

\ - denotes that statement is not ended its continued in next line



output formatting

a=3
b=4

print("thevalue of a is {} and b is {}".format(a,b) ## default value

a goes in the first {} and b goes in the second by default


print("thevalue of a is {1} and b is {0}".format(a,b) ## default value

b will be
